  abstract = {country\_codes is a new data frame that contains ISO 3166-1 country codes (\#16 @jrebane). Import tibble::tibble(), so tibble printing is used out of the box. Moved delimited files for practicing data import into inst/extdata/. Therefore, these are now accessible after installation at, e.g., system.file("extdata", "gapminder.tsv", package = "gapminder"). Clarify that this package is not maintained as a definitive data source, rather it's for making code examples and teaching. Stability is now very important. Improved citability, e.g. added the "concept" DOI that links to a list of all version to DESCRIPTION and README. README also shows the use of citation().},

  abstract = {What a Waste is a global project to aggregate data on solid waste management from around the world. This database features the statistics collected through the effort, covering nearly all countries and over 330 cities. The metrics included cover all steps from the waste management value chain, including waste generation, composition, collection, and disposal, as well as information on user fees and financing, the informal sector, administrative structures, public communication, and legal information. The information presented is the best available based on a study of current literature and limited conversations with waste agencies and authorities. While there may be variations in the definitions and quality of reporting for individual data points, general trends should reflect the global reality. All sources and any estimations are noted.},
