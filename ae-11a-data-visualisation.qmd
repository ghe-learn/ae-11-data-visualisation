## What a waste!

What a Waste is a global project to aggregate data on solid waste management from around the world. This database features the statistics collected through the effort, covering nearly all countries and over 330 cities. Beyond waste generation, there are a long list of additina indicators in this dataset.

## World Development Indicators (WDI)

World Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.

# Data visualisation

## Aesthetic mappings

Main aesthetic mappings:

-   x
-   y
-   color/fill
-   shape
-   size
-   alpha (Transparency)


## Scaling

All functions that adapt the scale start with `scale_` followed by the aesthetic to be adapted, e.g. `x_`, and then followed by the type of variable, e.g. `continouous`. So to adapt a continuous scale on an x-axis, the function to use is: `scale_x_continuous()`

### Axis scales



### Color scales

-   scale_color_brewer()



-   scale_color_manual()

```{r}

my_colors <- c("#ED6D37", "#901C6C", "#18A5C5", "#A6CE8F")


```

## Geoms

Aesthetic mappings are typically defined within the `ggplot()` function. Everyone geom that follows will use the same aesthetic mappings to visualise the data.

```{r}



```

If we want to define a mapping for one geom only, then the aesthetic mappings must be included in the function of that geom, here `geom_point()`. We can even use additional data in the same plot for an individual geom, see `geom_text()`. - defined for a geom only - geom_text

```{r}

waste_gdp_data_filter <- waste_gdp_data %>% 
  filter(capita_kg_year > 850 | 
           country_name == "Switzerland" |
           country_name == "Canada")



```

## Labels



## Theme

A reference to @fig-plot-waste-gdp.

```{r}

#| label: fig-plot-waste-gdp
#| fig-cap: "Global Municipal Solid Waste generation over GPD per capita, illustrated by defined income groups."


```
